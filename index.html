                <p>Hi, my name is Mitchel Busnel. This is my first website ever!! I coded this thing completely from scratch, and while it doesn't look very pretty, it gets the job done for now! I plan to add to this portfolio with more work once I am more developed, but this website itself was quite a challenge: especially since I have had no prior coding experience at all. I'm trying my best, and while it might not look great, all I want is to get better and become a successful coder!</p>

                <p>One of the most difficult assignments I've had to work on, the Password Generator is a fully functional random password generator that will generate a string of characters chosen by the user. You can choose if you want numbers, letters, special characters, and capitals to be included. Click the image preview to check it out!</p>

                <p>Skyrim, ironically enough, is where most of my computer experience came from. The modding scene in particular is what exposed me to interior game design and file management, which helped with learning about repositories. Mods for skyrim can be a lot harder to install and initialize than you think, especially if you want them to work your own way!</p>
