                <p>Hi, my name is Mitchel Busnel. This is my first website ever!! I coded this thing completely from scratch, and while it doesn't look very pretty, it gets the job done for now! I plan to add to this portfolio with more work once I am more developed, but this website itself was quite a challenge: especially since I have had no prior coding experience at all. I'm trying my best, and while it might not look great, all I want is to get better and become a successful coder!</p>
