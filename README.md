<h1>It's finally done!!</h1>

My website is finally finished after a week of work! It's not much, but it's a huge accomplishment for me! It contains the work I have so far, and info about me as well! And it was made from scratch by somebody with zero coding experience prior to taking this course! Progress, baby!!
